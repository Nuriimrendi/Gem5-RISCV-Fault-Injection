# Gem5 RISC-V Fault Injection Project

This project demonstrates fault injection on a RISC-V architecture using the Gem5 simulator.

## Setup
1. Install Gem5 and all required dependencies.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `run_simulation.py` to start the fault injection simulation.

## File Structure
- `run_simulation.py`: Main script to run the Gem5 simulation with fault injection.
- `gem5_config.py`: Configuration file for Gem5 simulation setup.
- `input_files/`: Contains the input files for the simulation.
- `results/`: Contains the output files, such as `stats.txt`.
- `analysis/`: Contains visualizations or any analysis output.

## Results
- The results of the simulation are stored in `results/stats.txt`.
